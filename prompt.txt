Design a highly artistic and visually striking website layout that captures the chaotic and vibrant spirit of the 'madding' aesthetic. Incorporate background colors with bold, contrasting hues to create a dynamic backdrop. Use text styles reminiscent of stabilo markers, such as bold, colorful outlines or highlights, to emphasize headings and key content. The design should evoke an energetic, rebellious atmosphere, with an intentionally unpolished, freeform layout that emulates the creative chaos of 'madding'. Focus on integrating these elements cohesively to produce a website that is both artistically compelling and thematically consistent with the concept of artistic mayhem.
